						<strong>GENERAL TERMS</strong>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Inquiring a commission, you will be following the proposed terms
								of service below. Terms can change or be added at any time.
							</li>
							<li>
								Please, be kind and patient. I will treat you with all respect,
								and I want to be treated with all due respect too. If your
								behavior in any way makes me uncomfortable or embarrassed, your
								commission may be cancelled.
							</li>
							<li>
								In case you do not follow the rules of terms, your commission
								may be cancelled. <br />
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						<strong>ORDERS AND PAYMENT</strong>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Via discord: <strong>@/tozeos</strong> or via Ko-fi:
								<a
									href="https://t.co/zH4ViThaie"
									rel="noreferrer ugc nofollow"
									target="_blank"
									title="‌"
								>
									ko-fi.com/tozeos
								</a>
								.
							</li>
							<li>
								I may or may not accept the order for reasons such as
								complexity, time constraints, etc. I have the right to refuse
								the commission without further explanation.
							</li>
							<li>
								The customer must send the character(s) and background
								details/references of the art as clear as possible, the more
								information they give about expressions, poses, physical
								characteristics, and personality, the better. If by any chance
								the customer requires changes after the final design is done, an
								extra percentage will be charged or even the changes might not
								be done.
							</li>
							<li>
								In case the client wants the artist to create a character
								without any references to images or illustrations, only based on
								the information given in text, an extra fee will be charged
								depending on the complexity of the art.
							</li>
							<li>
								Payment must be made through PayPal, in USD (United States
								Dollars), via PIX, via invoice or by sending me your email so
								that I can make the payment request. If payment is made via
								payment slip, it's mandatory to send the payment voucher, or
								else I must wait until the receipt of the money in my bank
								account to continue the commission work.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						<strong>PRODUCTION</strong>
						<ol>
							<li>
								When the order is placed, a draft will be made according to the
								customer's specifications. When finalized, it will be shown for
								approval or denial. If approved, the payment is required to
								continue.
							</li>
							<li>
								Once payment is made, I will start working your piece straight
								away. The deadline for finalizing the art may vary according to
								the complexity of the work and the time available for drawing,
								so keep that in mind.
							</li>
							<li>
								During the ending of the creation process, I will constantly
								show it for you to analyze and be aware of any changes. However,
								you can see the artwork at any time during the process if you
								request it in advance.
							</li>
							<li>
								You can request changes to the artwork before the finalization
								and painting step. Once finalized, if you request an extra
								change, there will be a charge or even the changes may not be
								carried out depending on the complexity.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						<strong>REFUND</strong>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Before making any payment, make sure that you will not regret
								having requested the service, as I will
								<strong>not make a refund</strong> after payment.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						<strong>DELIVERY</strong>
						<ol>
							<li>
								After the art is done it will be sent to the customer's email in
								high-definition quality which may be in PNG or GIF file format,
								according to the customer preferences.
							</li>
							<li>
								The orders will be made and delivered following the order and
								payment queue, which means that the customer who ordered and
								paid first must receive them first.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
